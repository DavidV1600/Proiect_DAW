### Prerequisites

Ensure you have .NET 6.0+ and the latest version of Node.js and npm installed to run Angular. These are necessary to execute the backend and frontend of the application, respectively.

```
git clone https://github.com/DavidV1600/Proiect_DAW.git

2. Start the local host to the backend directory of the project:

```
dotnet run
```

3. In a new terminal window, navigate to the frontend directory of the project:

```
cd Front-End
```

4. Install the necessary Angular dependencies:

```
npm install
```
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

5. To run the frontend, execute:

```
ng serve --open
```

This command will automatically open the website in your browser.
